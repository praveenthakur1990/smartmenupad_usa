                <p>
                    Your customer may not always want to come to the restaurant. When they like to not step out, offer your restaurant
                    services to them in the comfort of their homes. Around 60% of millennials prefer getting food delivered to their homes
                    or pick it up from the restaurant. It makes it essential for you to have a digital menu to facilitate online ordering. A
                    simple, user-friendly, and attractive menu will keep the user engaged with your ordering services. Make it detailed with
                    the help of images and text to help your customers.

                <p>
                    Online menus offer you the facility of keeping your menu system updated and managed. Unlike traditional paper menus, you
                    don’t have the barrier of not being able to edit, add, or delete any sort of information. You can integrate the menu of
                    multiple chains of your restaurant and update it in an easy way whenever you want. Be it the addition of a new chef’s
                    special dish, or the intimation of a new offer for the day, a few taps on your mobile device, and your menu is updated,
                    ready to go!
